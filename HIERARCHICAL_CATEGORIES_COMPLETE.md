## 🗄️ **Database Structure**

### Categories Hierarchy:
```
👔 clothing (Parent Category)
   ├── 👨 mens-wear (Child Category)
   ├── 👩 womens-wear (Child Category) 
   └── 👶 kids-wear (Child Category)
```

### Category IDs:
- **Parent**: `clothing` (68b95e4facbb6d4394b0aac6)
- **Child 1**: `mens-wear` (68b95e93acbb6d4394b0aad0)
- **Child 2**: `womens-wear` (68b95ecbacbb6d4394b0aada)
- **Child 3**: `kids-wear` (68b95f60acbb6d4394b0aaea)

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **When User Visits `/categories/clothing`:**
1. ✅ Shows clothing subcategory navigation (Men's, Women's, Kids)
2. ✅ Displays ALL products from clothing parent category
3. ✅ Also includes products from ALL child categories (mens-wear, womens-wear, kids-wear)
4. ✅ User can filter, search, sort within all clothing products

### **When User Visits `/categories/clothing/mens-wear`:**
1. ✅ Shows ONLY men's wear products
2. ✅ All filters work specifically for men's wear
3. ✅ Can search within men's wear products only

### **API Logic:**
```javascript
// Parent category query
filter.categoryId = { $in: [parentId, child1Id, child2Id, child3Id] }

// Specific subcategory query  
filter.categoryId = specificChildId
```

  if (subcategory) {
    // Filter by specific subcategory only
    filter.categoryId = specificChildCategoryId
  } else {
    // Filter by parent + all children
    filter.categoryId = { $in: [parentId, ...childIds] }
  }
}
```
